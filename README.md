We are planning to build an application that will provide services such as, automatically adding and removing name of a person from the electoral roll using Azure Block chain.
It will be an application and once you are registered on it using your Aadhaar number, you will be automatically registered as a voter and your voter ID will be sent to you. Also when the person dies, and his death record is registered,the application will directly deregister him/her from the electoral records.
This will be helpful as due to automatic registration, every person will be registered on the electoral rolls. The people who don't get registered because of minor caste or some other regions are also registered provided they have aadhar card. Another issue that can be resolved is that because of automatic deregistration from electoral roll, we can get a more accurate voting percentage.
To start the project we will be using blockchain for automatic registration and deregistration of the people.
DataSet : Aadhar card number of all the people or Aadhar virtual IDs.
Technology : Azure Blockchain
